The solution to your problem is to use a tech stack that keeps the **IFC data model as the single source of truth**, performing all editing and saving operations directly on the IFC data itself. This avoids the one-way conversion issue you are concerned about.

# 1

Given your technology choices, there are two primary workflows to consider, each with a different role for the Frappe backend.

***

### 1. The Lossless, Client-Side Workflow

This is the approach we've refined, which ensures data integrity by keeping the IFC data model as the single source of truth in the browser's memory. In this scenario, Frappe acts primarily as a static file server.

1.  **Nuxt UI**: The user navigates to the Nuxt-based web app and initiates an IFC file upload from their local machine.
2.  **In-Browser Processing**: The `@thatopen/components` library, running in the browser, loads and parses the `.ifc` file using its internal WebAssembly module.
3.  **In-Memory Data**: Two representations are created in the client's RAM:
    * A **complete, lossless in-memory IFC model** for all data and properties.
    * A **performance-optimized `.frag` model** for rendering the geometry.
4.  **Local Editing**: All user changes (to geometry or properties) are made directly to the **in-memory IFC model**.
5.  **Local Save**: When the user saves, the library writes the updated in-memory model to a new `.ifc` file on the user's disk.

**Frappe's Role**: Frappe's role is minimal, serving the Nuxt frontend files and perhaps handling user authentication or a simple file upload to a temporary storage, but it is not involved in any data conversion or processing.

### 2. The Collaborative, Backend-Assisted Workflow

This approach is necessary for multi-user, collaborative applications where data must be stored persistently.

1.  **Frappe Backend API**: The Nuxt frontend sends the uploaded `.ifc` file to Frappe via its API.
2.  **Server-Side Conversion**: Frappe uses a Python library like `IfcOpenShell` or a dedicated service to parse the IFC file and convert it into a graph database format (e.g., RDF, or a direct graph model).
3.  **Database Storage**: Frappe stores this data in a persistent database (e.g., a graph database like Neo4j, or a triplestore).
4.  **Frontend Display**: The Nuxt frontend queries the Frappe API for the necessary data to display the model. The API returns a lightweight, display-optimized data set (e.g., `.frag` files or a JSON representation of the model) which `@thatopen/components` can render.
5.  **Collaborative Editing**: User edits in the Nuxt UI trigger API calls to Frappe, which updates the central database.
6.  **Server-Side Save**: When a user wants to save, Frappe uses `IfcOpenShell` to **reconstruct the `.ifc` file from the database** and provides it to the user for download.

**Frappe's Role**: Frappe is the central nervous system, handling data ingestion, storage, API management, and the final reconstruction of the IFC file.

Here is a recommended open-source solution stack and workflow:

### Posible Tech Stack

This stack take ifc format as the basis, not just as import, but writing to ifc is impotnt to us.

* **Backend (Data Management & Editing):** **Frappe** a server-side framework with **IfcOpenShell** (a powerful IFC library). This handles all the critical IFC reading, editing, and saving operations.
* **Frontend (User Interface & Viewer):** **Nuxt** a modern JavaScript framework integrated with a specialised client-side viewer based on @thatopen/components.

### Workflow

This workflow enables a full round-trip of editing and saving directly to an IFC file:

1.  **IFC File Upload & Storage:**
    * The user uploads an `.ifc` file via the **Nuxt** frontend.
    * The file is sent to **Frappe** backend, which stores it securely on the server.

2.  **Server-Side Processing:**
    * The backend uses **IfcOpenShell** to load and parse the `.ifc` file. The entire IFC data model is now available in memory on the server.
    * Instead of converting it, the server extracts the necessary 3D geometry and property data into a lightweight, temporary format (e.g., JSON or a binary format like BFAST). This data is optimised for fast transmission to the browser.

3.  **Client-Side Viewing & Interaction:**
    * The **Nuxt** frontend receives the lightweight data from the server.
    * Viewer uses this data to render the 3D model in the browser, allowing the user to navigate, select objects, and view properties.

4.  **Client-Side Editing & Data Transmission:**
    * The user makes changes in the browser (e.g., edits a wall's height, moves a window, or changes a property value).
    * The **Nuxt** frontend captures these changes and sends them back to the **Frappe** backend via an API call.

5.  **Server-Side IFC File Update:**
    * The **Frappe** backend receives the changes.
    * Using **IfcOpenShell**, it applies these edits to the original IFC data model that is still being held in memory.
    * Once the edits are applied, **IfcOpenShell** writes a completely new, updated `.ifc` file to the server. This new file incorporates all the user's changes while preserving the rest of the original data model.

This approach ensures that the `.ifc` file itself is the central point of truth, making your application truly open and interoperable.
